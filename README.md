# Book Connect Web Components

This repository focuses on evolving the "Book Connect" codebase by further iterating on abstractions and introducing web components.

## Overview

Building upon the previous work involving the abstraction of the book preview functionality, the goal is to transform the book preview abstraction into a fully-functional web component. 
Additionally, explore the opportunity to convert other aspects of the application into web components.

## Implementation

### Book Preview Web Component

The primary task involves turning the book preview abstraction into a fully-working web component. This step aims to encapsulate the book preview functionality within a modular and reusable component.

### Additional Web Components

Consider extending the use of web components to other elements within the application. Assess which elements make sense to convert into web components, and implement them accordingly.

## Questions Addressed

1. **Problems Encountered:**
   - Reflect on challenges faced during the conversion of the book preview to a web component.

2. **Other Elements as Web Components:**
   - Identify and discuss elements within the app that are suitable for conversion into web components, providing reasons for your choices.

3. **Single File Approach:**
   - Explore the rationale behind keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file, and when this approach makes sense in the context of the project.
